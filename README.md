## ⚙️ Configuration Options

You can customize the downloader's behavior using command-line arguments:

<details>
<summary><b>🔄 Concurrent Downloads: `--concurrent N`</b></summary>

**What it does:**
- Controls the number of simultaneous downloads
- **Default**: `5` concurrent downloads
- Higher values = faster downloads, but may trigger rate limiting
- Lower values = slower but more stable

**Examples**:

Use default (5 concurrent downloads):
```bash
python main.py
```

Conservative - 3 concurrent downloads:
```bash
python main.py --concurrent 3
```

Faster - 10 concurrent downloads:
```bash
python main.py --concurrent 10
```

Sequential - 1 download at a time (slowest, but safest):
```bash
python main.py --concurrent 1
```

**💡 Recommendations:**
- **3-5 concurrent downloads**: Safe default, respectful to Snapchat's servers
- **10-15 concurrent downloads**: Faster, works well on most home connections
- **20+ concurrent downloads**: May trigger rate limiting or server throttling
- **1 concurrent download**: Use only if experiencing connection issues

> ⚠️ **Note**: Setting too high may result in rate limiting or failed downloads. If you experience issues, reduce the concurrent value.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎨 Media Overlays: `--no-overlay`</b></summary>

**What it does:**
- Snapchat stores your memories with separate layers for text, stickers, drawings, etc. you added
- **By default**, this tool automatically applies those edits on top of your photos and videos, just like you see them in the Snapchat app
- **Images**: Text, stickers, drawings, etc. are permanently added to the image
- **Videos**: Text, stickers, drawings, etc. are burned into the video throughout playback
- Use `--no-overlay` if you want the original media **without** any of your edits

**Examples**:

Default behavior - downloads photos/videos WITH text, stickers, drawings, etc.:
```bash
python main.py
```

Skip overlays - downloads original photos/videos WITHOUT any edits:
```bash
python main.py --no-overlay
```

**💡 Recommendations:**
- **Default (with overlays)**: Best for preserving your memories exactly as you saved them in Snapchat
- **With `--no-overlay`**: Best if you want clean, unedited original photos/videos for editing or archival purposes

> **Example**: If you saved a photo with "Best day ever! 🎉" text, heart stickers, and some doodles on it in Snapchat, the default download will include all of that. With `--no-overlay`, you get the clean original photo without any edits.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>⏰ Download Links Expired</b></summary>

Snapchat download links expire after a period of time. If downloads fail, try to export a fresh `memories_history.json` from Snapchat and replace the old one in the `data/` folder.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📄 Missing `memories_history.json`</b></summary>

When exporting your data from Snapchat, make sure you select **both** options:
- ✅ **Export your Memories**
- ✅ **Export JSON Files**

Without these options, the JSON file won't be included in your export.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🆘 Still Having Issues?</b></summary>

Please open a new [issue](https://github.com/Reelinq/snapchat-memories-extractor/issues) with the following information:
- Your Python version (`python --version`)
- Operating system
- Error message or unexpected behavior
- Whether the issue is with images or videos
